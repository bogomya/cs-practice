The first line contains the number of objects 1≤n≤10^3 and the capacity of the backpack 0≤W≤2*10^6. 
Each of the following n lines containts the price 0≤c≤2⋅10^6 and the amount 0 <w≤2⋅10^6 of the objects (n, W, c, w are integers), which can be placed to the backpack. 
Output the maximum cost of parts of objects (from each object you can separate any part, the cost and volume will decrease proportionally), placed in this backpack, with an accuracy of at least three digits after the decimal point.
